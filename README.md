## 1. Introduction

The Decentralized Service Listing Platform is a blockchain-based application that allows users to create and list services they offer, and other users can purchase these services using ERC-20 tokens. It provides a transparent and secure way to conduct service transactions without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Key features of this platform include:
- ERC-20 Token Integration: Services are listed and purchased using ERC-20 tokens, providing a standardized and interoperable currency for transactions.
- Decentralization: The platform operates on a decentralized network, ensuring transparency and security.
- Solidity Smart Contracts: The core functionality is implemented using Solidity, a smart contract programming language for Ethereum.

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the Decentralized Service Listing Platform, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Ethereum Wallet: You need an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the platform.
2. Ethereum Testnet Tokens: Get some testnet Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens for testing purposes.
3. Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Decentralized Service Listing Platform:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/corps21/0xListService.git
   cd 0xListService
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contracts to the Ethereum testnet or a local blockchain. You will need to configure your deployment parameters in the Solidity smart contract files.

4. Start the web application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the platform through a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 3. Usage

Here are the basic steps to use the Decentralized Service Listing Platform:

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform.
2. Browse listed services and choose the one you want to purchase.
3. Click the "Purchase" button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
4. Once the transaction is confirmed, the service provider will receive the payment, and the service will be marked as purchased.

## 4. Smart Contracts

The core functionality of the platform is implemented in Solidity smart contracts. Here is an overview of the main smart contracts:

- `Subscription.sol`: This contract handles the creation, listing, and purchase of services. It also manages the escrow of funds during transactions.

To deploy these contracts, you can use tools like Remix or Truffle.
